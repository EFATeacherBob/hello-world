Setting up for Eleven Fifty Academy
I'm Bob Madison, a new instructor for EFA. It's going to be a really great career at EFA. The flexibility I'm getting is truly fantastic. I'm a retired Air Force officer and former Marine. My wife, Diana, and I have two sons, two daughters-in-law and five grandchildren (Three granddaughters: Alana 13, Arianny 9, and Ava 7. Two grandsons: Aiden 11, and Maxwell 4.75.) I also teach part-time at Purdue.
